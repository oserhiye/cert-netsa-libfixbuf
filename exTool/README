Example export tool which uses Fixbuf IPFIX protocol library
 It uses command line parameters:
  @param filename - file with template and data to export
  @param host - ip address of a collector
  @param port - port number collector uses (usually 4739)

As of now it exports only by using UDP connection

exTool.c
- source code for the tool

build.sh
hw_build.sh
- hack scripts to build library and tool bypassing configure and automake
  for proof-of-concept only, don't expect them to work, tested only on ubuntu

testFile.txt
- file with template and data to export
  exists as a demo and example of syntax
  tool can export it, which is tested

Enjoy
